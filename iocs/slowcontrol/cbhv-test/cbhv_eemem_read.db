# This record obtains the values for every eemem value except the
# M<numbe> and N<number> values. It could have been realised together
# with '....Set<Eememvalue>' record, but as then both would use the
# same pattern in the .sub file, it would be possible to write to
# eemem values that should be read only. As per .db file only one
# pattern is possible, the best way to make sure read only values are
# really read only is to create a separate pattern for read eemem pvs,
# so for setting eemem values the read only values (like R1 and R2 do
# not exist) - just compare the patterns for the cbhvtest_eemem_read.db
# and cbhvtest_eemem_set.db file in the cbhvtest.sub file.
